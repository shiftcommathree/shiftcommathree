### What did one ocean say to the other? Nothing, they just **_waved_**! **_Sea_** what I did there? I'm **_shore_** you did.
### Hi, I'm Shiftcommathree 👋

You can usually find me in my natural habitat competently browsing stackoverflow, whipping my hair back and forth and doing some socially unacceptable thing such as laughing at my own puns. On my free time, I do enjoy going outside to remind myself that the world doesn't revolve around my basement (if only...).

I'm currently residing in 1 Bunny Way, Bunnyville with my 2 pet bunnies Teysa & Azura 🐰🐰

Thank you for stopping by.
